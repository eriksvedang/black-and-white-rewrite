  <h1>Black & White - unoffical (clarified) rules</h1>
  <p>The boardgame <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164259/black-white">Black & White</a> by Krzysztof Matusik is a very cool and good looking war game, oozing with style. Unfortunately the rules are a bit unclear, so this document tries to be a source of truth for those wanting to play the game in the most correct and enjoyable way possible. In the situations where the official rule book is ambiguos I've primarily tried to get the correct ruling from the board game geek <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164259/black-white/forums/66">forums</a> for the game. In the cases where there is no official answer, I've tried to come up with my own ruling that is as fun and close to the "spirit of the game" as possible. <strong>Please note that this is just my interpretation of the rules and not official in any way</strong>.</p>
